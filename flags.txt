Binary Exploitation


Cryptography
    Mod 26 - 10 pts. Pretty simple Caesar Cipher. Appears to only use the alphabet,
    upper- and lowercase. This was a basic ROT13 cipher, but could be brute-forced easily
    enough.

Forensics


General Skills
    Obedient Cat - 5pts. Contained a file I could obtain in the webshell via
    'wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static..../flag'. From there I was able to
    use 'cat flag' to concatenate the contents of the file and obtain the flag.

    Python Wrangling - 10pts. Learned some new webshell skills with this one. Given
    a python script, flag, and text file containing a password I was able to ru in the 
    webshell, once, all in the same directory. All files obtained with 'wget'. Learned
    to pass system arguments to Python. Ran 'python ende.py -d flag.txt.en', the last
    argument being the text file containing the flag. '-d' was a system argument telling
    Python to run the Decrypt function in the script.

    Wave a flag - 10 pts. Given a file called "warrm" that can be obtained in the webshell via
    'wget'. Had to make it executable using 'chmod +x warm'. Ran it using ./warm -h to see if 
    it had any help info, which is where the flag was stored.

    Nice netcat... - 15pts. Used 'nc mercury.picoctf.net 22342' to obtain a string of numbers
    that were ASCII values. Pretty simple to convert them to characters. Would be interesting 
    to see if string output could be directly piped to ASCII characters.
