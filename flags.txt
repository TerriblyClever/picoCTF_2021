    Static ain't always noise: used 'wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/ec4dbd8898ade34e1d60d5b70c1b8c8c/static'
    to download the flag in the web shell first; tried 'cat static' which output
    a lot of unreadable characters, so tried 'strings static'; modifed to
    "strings static | grep 'pico'" to filter for the flag and there it was.
        flag: picoCTF{d15a5m_t34s3r_98d35619}
